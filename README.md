# Virtual Reality Calculus

This repository contains an educational VR application developed as part of my final year project at the University of Bristol under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Calway and Dr. Oussama Metatla. The application is conceptualised as a teaching aid for elementary calculus concepts. In its current state, it serves only as a proof of concept. The technology was evaluated with secondary-level mathematics students in Ireland. 

The thesis presented gives a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, focusing on educational psychology and the history of educational technologies in calculus. Each stage of development is then detailed, along with the principles which informe this design. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the evaluation and results. 

- The "FinalBuild" contains an executable file named "FinalYearProject" for running the application. Note that this requires a computer with advanced graphics capabilities.

- The "Python" folder contains the .ipynb and .py file used for generating the graphs used in the application.

- The "Unity" folder contains all relevant unity files, assets, packages, etc. The "VirtualRealityCalculusEducation" folder can be opened in Unity.

- The "Scripts" folder contains all scripts that were either written or edited as part of the project.

- The "SteamVR Interaction Scripts" folder contains all scripts that were taken from the SteamVR Interaction System library.
